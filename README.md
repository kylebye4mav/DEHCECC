To run, use an IDE. Set DEHHCECC as the Main class and the IDE's run function after importing.

Description:
Just run around as a creepy neutral face and check out the cool houses made in MS Paint.

Camera Effect:
The Camera Effect I implemented is an effect that rotates the camera 180. The longer
the key bind is held, the longer the effect lasts.

Controls (shown in game):

WASD to move.
SHIFT + WASD to move faster.
G to flip the camera. The longer you hold, the longer the camera effect lasts.
j - to jail
u - to unlock the jail
